README for GNOME sound converter application
============================================

A simple sound converter application for the GNOME environment. It reads
anything the GStreamer library can read, and writes WAV, FLAC, MP3, and
Ogg Vorbis files.

This application is somewhat less fast than various command line tools.
Not a whole lot, however, and not enough to make me worry about
performance for the foreseeable future. If you want ultimate
performance, the command line tools are always going to be preferable.

Supported audio formats
-----------------------

All file formats that GStreamer can read from should now be supported
(thanks to the wonderful "decodebin" element). The supported output
formats are:

==========  ==========
Type        Supported?
==========  ==========
Ogg Vorbis  yes
FLAC        yes
Wave        yes
MP3         yes
M4A         yes
==========  ==========
